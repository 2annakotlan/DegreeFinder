Analyzing retellings within contemporary popular culture, this course investigates reimagining of previously told tales and asks students to get beyond the question of whether or not there is an original text that should be preserved or that is better, but to critically engage with the creative, cultural, and political aspects of revision, translation, and adaptation. This course moves beyond traditional understandings of adaptation to encourage thinking about the more complicated ways that narratives migrate across platforms and creative networks. Students will read multiple genres: folk tales, poetry, novels, films, graphic novels, games, and social media.', 'Horror/Sci-Fi in Film and Television': 'Horror and science-fiction in film and television offer unique insight into the consequences of the “what if?” scenario. Overlapping in shared codes, conventions, and iconography, these genres provide a means to debate cautionary tales surrounding unforeseen futures, usually dystopias, through the creation or existence of unimaginable beings as a detriment to humanity. Their most central conveyance concerns the perception of the “other” and a protagonist’s struggle to remain or become human and/or moral. Issues of gender, race, sexuality, class, and sustainability will be surveyed through such topics as disaster (e.g., alien invasions, environmental catastrophes, the apocalypse, and pandemics); identity (e.g., cyborgs, clones, biotech and government experimentation, precognition, and artificial intelligence); and the fantastical (e.g., monsters, the paranormal, time travel, and the devil incarnate.

Classwork includes multiple writing assignments, workshops to critique student work, in-class exercises, and analysis of the work of noted playwrights or screenwriters. Assignments and classroom discussion focus on dramatic form, character development, dialogue writing, and plot construction.', 'Creative Nonfiction/Essay Writing': 'Personal essay and memoir are among the most popular forms of literature today, a fact one can confirm by looking any Sunday at the best-seller list in the New York Times. This course emphasizes creativity of expression and provides an opportunity to practice these genres. It encourages experimentation with a variety of first-person forms and shows how to treat subjects that students know about and that are important to them. It is conducted as a workshop in which students share their work with and learn from one another. Frequent individual conferences with the instructor are required. The class is limited in size.', 'Creative Writing and Multimedia Production': 'Each student chooses his or her own work (family history or memoir, love poetry or satire, nature or adventure writing, among others). Using class and individual exercises, videotaped inspiration, and guests discussing their own work in progress, students will learn the major skills of each written genre to apply to their own special piece. Includes word choice, imagery, language rhythm, conflict, characterization, narrative intervention and tone. Other overarching concerns that professional writers struggle with include subtext, production and intention. The class is limited in size.', 'American Icons': 'Meet three commonly identified American icons - the cowboy, the capitalist and the feminist - to see what they reveal about themselves and U.S. culture. Through literature, film, historical documents and narratives, students will see how these representations of America evolve and change in response to changes in society itself, and how they differ from icons in other cultures. The course addresses ethnic, racial and other variations in American life embodied in these American icons.', 'American Landscapes': 'In this course we engage with the interdisciplinary field of “ecocriticism.” This means that we use a variety of theories and critical frameworks to analyze the relationship between cultural texts—literature, film, the visual arts—and the physical environment. Our aim is to understand how those texts reflect and articulate evolving concepts of nature and the nonhuman through engagements with a range of cultural studies discourses on race, gender, class, etc. We also look at how theories connect with the practice of environmental activism.', 'American Cities in Literature': 'This course uses literary texts as a lens through which to look at American cities and their significance in American culture in general and American literature in particular. It aims at understanding urban American intellectual and social culture, and the architecture, music, politics and philosophy that embody it. Students will examine five important U.S. cities New York, New Orleans, Chicago, Nashville and Los Angeles as case studies of American life at moments of dramatic technological and cultural change. Students will study the work of some of the premier creative writers and thinkers in American history, from the Romantic authors who generated a literary Renaissance in Boston to the musicians of Memphis and the counter-cultural activists of San Francisco. Readings for the course include texts by Henry James, Theodore Dreiser, Tennessee Williams and Joan Didion.', 'American Cities in Film': 'This course examines the image of the city in American film. Close attention is paid to issues of race and sexual orientation amid the multiple, sometimes conflicting, portrayals of urban centers as places of refuge and violence, liberalism and intolerance, prosperity and poverty. While setting provides the conceptual theme of the course, students are invited to analyze these films from the widest possible array of perspectives, grounded in the critical approaches relevant to the discipline of cinema studies and interpretation of narrative meanings.', 'Sitcom Nation: The American Family in Fiction and Film': 'The nurturing nuclear families of television sitcoms such as "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" are often idealized by contemporary Americans anxious about and frustrated by contemporary family conflicts and complexities. The media converts these anxieties into consumable types (e.g., the deadbeat dad) and positions them against the sitcom ideal of the self-sacrificing mother and tough, but loving, father. By analyzing literary and cinematic responses to "classic" TV sitcom representations of American familial and cultural norms, this course explores the entrenchment of and challenges to gendered (and race- and class-based) family ideals. It addresses the impact of consumerism and the media on people\'s perceptions of the ideal American family and their own distance from its norms. As this is a Communication Intensive section, it includes writing workshops and individual writing conferences in which students develop and hone their oral and written communication skills.', 'Black Lives Matter: African American Literature and Culture': 'The contemporary response to state violence against African Americans has a long and moving history. This course begins with a historical context, briskly surveying the years in and around the Harlem Renaissance before transitioning into the literature and music of the modern era. We engage in a deep study of the Civil Rights Movement (from James Baldwin to Marvin Gaye), and the course concludes with the artistic production of the hip-hop generation. History and politics are the theme, but the emphasis throughout the course is on using literary methods to interpret the aesthetic value of protest art.', 'Latina/o/x Literature and Culture': 'This course introduces students to the presence and historical legacy of Latina/o/x literature and culture. It takes a broad sweep of the textual production of Latina/o/x writers through a range of texts such as historical documents, poetry, allegories, novels, short stories, and autobiographies. These selected texts move students from early colonial encounters to the work of contemporary authors such as Valeria Luiselli and Carmen Maria Machado. Students focus on the diverse cultural backgrounds and shared experiences that shaped Latina/o/x Literature in the US as well as how writers developed narrative strategies in response to colonial histories, immigration (and migration), racial constructions, and mixed identities.', 'Native American Literature and Culture': 'In this course students will examine the long history of Native American textual production, from early Native writers such as Samson Occum and William Apess to contemporary authors including Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie. Within these readings students will focus on narrative strategies for physical and cultural survival and remembrance in the face of colonialism and erasure. At the same time, students will investigate how native American writers deploy a diverse array of tactics and theories to consciously oppose stereotypes of Native identity in mainstream literature and film.', 'Immigrant and Ethnic Literature': 'The United States has been called "a nation of immigrants." Certainly ,most people living in the U.S., if not immigrants themselves, are the descendants of people who were born overseas and came to these shores seeking political asylum, religious freedom, or-most often- economic opportunity. Stories will reflect the pains and satisfactions of adjustment to American culture, as well as the sometimes troubled relations between immigrant parents and their American-born children. The ethnic groups represented in the course may change from semester to semester.', 'Black Cinema': 'This course combines close readings of film style and aesthetics with a careful examination of the cultural contexts of Black cinema. Students will examine how Black filmmakers have told stories that matter, invented new visual and sonic cinematic vocabularies, and worked to represent Black experiences within genres and industries that were designed with whiteness at the center. This course prioritizes work produced by Black filmmakers, but the course will also incorporate and analyze representations of Blackness constructed by members of other racial/ethnic groups. Students become acquainted with an array of cultural tropes and stereotypes before diving into the efforts of writers and directors to add complexity to Black images in cinema.', 'Passing in American Literature': "'Passing' refers to the conscious adoption of a new category of identity. While passing traditionally refers to the practice of African Americans passing as white, American literary history provides many examples of people who, for various reasons, assume another race, sexual identity or gender. This course examines fictional 20th-century representations of such passing in order to question the act of passing from a social and cultural perspective.", 'Women in Literature': "This course explores the literary representation of women's nature, lives and issues. The literary definitions and dynamics of women appear in such terms as self, voice, autonomy, relation to men, and position and agency in the world. The course considers whether the gender of the writer affects the literary treatment of the subject. The texts studied will vary each semester.", 'Women and Film': 'Women have shaped the development of cinema in many central ways sinceits beginning over a hundred years ago. This course surveys majorconcepts and analytic approaches in the study of women and film.Readings focus on the objectification of the female image, the agency offemale spectators, and the intersections of issues of gender and cinemawith race, class, and sexuality in an historical context. We alsoexamine discourses of the female star, confluences of gender and genre,and film production by women directors working within as well as outsideof Hollywood.', 'Wonder Women': 'From the preternatural strength of Buffy Summers to the sultry confidence of Jackie Brown, heroic women characters often have a profound and lasting impact on the cultural imagination. But when is "girl power" really challenging staid notions about gender roles, and when does it simply serve as a fantasy reinscription of old premises about women as servants, caregivers or sex objects? This course applies these critical concerns to a number of heroic, superheroic and antiheroic women characters in television and cinema.', 'The Male Image in American Film': 'This course examines how masculinity functions in cinematic narratives centered on Hollywood\'s "leading men." Students identify and critique notions about what makes a male protagonist heroic, or even more simply what makes him a functional citizen. This critique necessarily leads to a larger discussion about the evolving concepts of American culture, and how and why mainstream film champions the popular cultural impulse of rebellion. The course emphasizes the theoretical approaches of formalism (close reading) and deconstruction to relate a gendered reading of each character to these larger social concerns. Films examined may include "High Noon", "Strangers on a Train", "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "Midnight Cowboy", "The Shining", "American Beauty", and "Collateral."', 'LGBQ American Literature': 'From power lesbians to drag queens, representations of gay men, lesbians and bisexuals are now visible throughout popular culture. But when does a novel or film accurately reflect the lives of gay men, lesbians and bisexuals? And when do they simply reproduce stereotypes? This course surveys contemporary gay literature and cultural expression in American life since the advent of the gay rights movement in 1969. It explores the representation of sexual identity in language, the intersection of political and aesthetic goals, and the differences in representations in class, race and ethnicity. It asks what defines gay, lesbian and bisexual literature, what distinguishes contemporary gay, lesbian and bisexual literature from earlier texts, and how gay, lesbian and bisexual literature has changed.', 'Transgender American Literature': 'Trans literally means across or beyond. This course surveys recent American literature to ask how people journey across or beyond gender identity categories. Are terms like masculine and feminine, heterosexual and homosexual, and male and female always mutually exclusive? Or can they be negotiated? Who defines someones gender, the individual or society? The stories, novels, poetry and films discussed in this course utilize drama, humor and autobiographical events to convey the complexity of transgender lives and their variety, which includes cross-dressers, transsexuals and drag queens and kings, and any person whose gender identity or expression does not fit traditional categories.', 'Queer and Trans Media Studies': 'The goal of this cultural studies course is to give students an expanded critical vocabulary for talking about gender and sexuality. This course helps students think about the pasts, presents, and futures of gender and sexual citizenship. This course explores theories of identity, subjectivity, identification, representation, cultural texts, forms, and platforms. We explore temporal and spatial dimensions of queer and trans cultures and think through intersectionality: what it means to read bodies, performances, and constructions and their articulation in and between nation, globalization, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class.', 'Cultural Studies and the Body': 'This course explores how identity is constructed through cultural representations of the body. Through the study of literary texts, films, advertising, museums, laws, and sports, students will develop an understanding of how different types of discourses (legal, scientific, literary, popular, etc.) have categorized and positioned individuals and communities in terms of race, gender, class, sexuality, and (dis)ability.', 'Literature and Medicine': 'This course explores the relationship between literature and medicine through a range of texts concerned with health, illness, trauma, and care. Throughout the semester, we engage with representations of and responses to the rise of medical science from the early nineteenth century to the present. We read doctor memoirs, patient journals, and novels informed by the lived experience of illness and the various knowledges and traditions that have been employed in the service of healing. Topics we address include: rhetorical strategies in medical and literary writing; the inner-psychic and interpersonal nature of illness; the representation of medical ethics in literature; the role of narrative in the clinical setting; diverse and global therapeutic traditions.', 'Cultures of Contagion': 'This course explores the concept of contagion in U.S. literature and film, focusing on the ways that outbreak narratives shape human society as they point to the transmission of ideas as much as the transmission of microbes. The class focuses on aesthetic accounts of communicable disease to examine contagion as a foundational concept in the study of culture, religion, and society. In it, we analyze how contagion circulates not just across populations but also various scientific, journalistic, and creative sources, considering the many impacts of infectious disease on human interaction and imagination.', 'Money, Love, and Death: Colonialism in Literature and Culture': 'Students will explore colonialism as an important frame of reference for understanding contemporary cultures, and the connections among the themes of money, violence, love and colonialism, including cases involving U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Can there be love between people on opposite sides of a political conflict? How are the motives of romantic fantasy and profit connected in campaigns to exert political influence (hegemony) or dominance over another culture or group? To what extent is the legacy of colonialism a story of physical and emotional violence? What can we learn about our own lives from experiences such as European imperialism and Vietnam? Can we speak of an "internal colonialism," here in the culture we inhabit? Students will explore a broad range of cultural materials, both visual and textual, film and literature of the 19th and 20th centuries, to understand these and other complex questions about cross-cultural relationships.', 'Diasporic Literature and Culture': 'The term diaspora is of Greek origin and means “to scatter or disperse.” Its earliest usage was used to describe the dispersal of Jewish peoples. This course looks at cultural productions produced out of late modern formations of colonial capitalism. Students examine cultural texts: literature, film, music, and cultural practices that have evolved out of colonial capitalism’s political and economic processes and forces. We consider the social and cultural dimensions of migration as well as the transnational flows of ideas, capital, and people in the context of our contemporary notions of homeland, mother/father land, and host nation. We begin with the question of ontology, what diaspora means, and what it means to exist as a diasporic subject.', 'Caribbean Literature': "This course introduces students to the literature of the Caribbean. Texts will be selected from the offerings of several islands and from various genres: novel, poetry and short fiction. Emphasis will be placed on the shaping influences of the island's rich mystical heritage and on questions of personal identity. The effects of slavery, African cultural survivals, and the role played by the English, French and Spanish colonials, white creoles, mulattos and blacks in forming the cultural mosaic of the island will be studied. Students will read the works of such authors as V. S. Naipaul, Jean Rhys, Jacques Roumain, Derek Waltcott and Esmeralda Santiago, among others.", 'Images of the Hero': 'Heroes can be warriors or pacifists, romantics or realists, officers or outlaws, or a composite of all of these. The kind of hero a culture admires can tell us a lot about its values, its beliefs and its fears. This course examines male and female heroes from a spectrum of modern and traditional cultures. It considers how literary heroism functions as an expression of cultural values and social expectations. In exploring the ways that heroes do and do not function as role models, it also explores the conflict between individuality and social responsibility often revealed in heroic narratives.', 'Global Media': 'This course looks at international media industries, products and audiences to provide an introduction to a multinational and multiethnic culture. In addition to providing a strong general grasp of how international media are structured, the course focuses on how cultural and media products impact democracy internationally. Students consider the elements, interaction and impact of media culture and mass communication in national and international arenas, with special attention to questions of ideology, political economy and global democracy.', 'International Cinema': 'This course focuses on one of the wide varieties of important national cinemas or film movements that have played a major role in the development of film as a virtually universal artistic language. Topics to which the course might be devoted include German Expressionism; Soviet Cinema and Montage Theory; Post-war Italian Cinema, Rosellini through Bertolucci and beyond; the French New Wave; Japanese Cinema; and Bollywood and the development of film in India.', 'Youth Cultures in International Cinema': 'This course is a focused study of youth cultures in international cinema. We study films primarily as documents of youth culture: as explorations of the ways in which youth occupy urban and non-urban spaces, how they experience the local and the international, and how their identities and lives are represented in media, old and new. Assigned films will function as case studies enabling discussion of major issues: youth self-fashioning and identities, family, tradition and social change, violence, gang culture, fashion, technology, education, poverty, gender and sexuality. Our study of the films will be supplemented by extended scholarly essays that add depth and context, framing our study within broader critical discourses on culture and within scholarship in transnational film studies.', 'Intercultural Communication': 'This course explores theories of intercultural communication and the way in which specific cultural knowledge informs communication. The class will consider the ways race, class, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation and age affect communication within (domestic) and across (international) cultures. The course readings are drawn from a wide variety of sources. Some take a broad view and are theoretical. Others relate a piece of cultural knowledge or practice that has the potential to impact intercultural communication in a variety of ways. The class will view videos and occasionally listen to music as additional means of understanding some of the multiple ways different cultures go about communicating similar issues and tasks. The class involves a great deal of participation, and regular reflection on readings and experiences.', 'The Television Industry': 'Radio and television broadcasting are major parts of the U.S. economy, national identity and contemporary culture, yet their pervasiveness is rarely matched by critical scrutiny of how media become meaningful to audiences and to American society. Drawing on an integrated approach where the textual, industrial, policy, social and audience dimensions of broadcasting are considered, this course guides students through a survey of American broadcasting style, regulation and content. Readings, screenings and class discussions address the roles that American radio and television have played in constructing dominant and marginalized cultures. By examining the intersection of art and commerce in American radio and television, students analyze the ways that broadcasting content has evolved and how media industries have responded to social and regulatory change.', 'Disney+: Content + Platform': 'This course analyzes cinematic and cultural messaging in films and television controlled by Walt Disney, the media conglomerate that brings together Walt Disney Animation, Pixar, Marvel, LucasFilm, and Disney-ABC Television Group with Disney+ and Hulu streaming platforms. It considers cultural issues of gender, race, sexuality, and inclusion, while also discussing cinematic concerns related to animation, effects, casting, costuming, production worker agency, and corporate authorship. It evaluates how streaming platforms and the promotional screen industries generate awareness and circulate interpretive frames. The course begins and ends with how Disney+ has re-created many of the kinds of content/promotion shorts produced by Walt Disney for his 50’s Disneyland series, and addresses the ongoing cultural impact of Disney’s classic animation and other legacy properties even as the company has expanded and re-branded over the decades.', 'Hollywood Production Cultures': 'We consume media every day, but we rarely think about the people and institutions responsible for the look and sound of what we see and hear. In its focus on the narratives through which the production cultures in different creative industries describe themselves, this course addresses not only what it means to be a director, writer, cinematographer, music supervisor, composer, and/or web/game/graphic/costume designer, but also how those definitions frame creative work as well as the relationship of production cultures to fans, consumers, and American and global cultures. In addition to analyzing how film, television, music, gaming and new media firms construct corporate cultures via narrative and rhetorical strategies, the course considers how creative industries establish business models governing content production and distribution.', 'Hollywood Convergence': 'This course considers the changes to the structure and scope of Hollywood studio and TV network operations, especially in response to the emergence of new technologies, cross-media conglomerates, alternate content delivery systems (e.g., DVD, iPods, Hulu), and transnational patterns of circulation. Grounding its analysis of the millennial media industries in two case studies of midcentury studio systems, the course provides historical foundations for its examination of convergence culture; the technological, industrial, cultural and social changes in the way media circulates in and between cultures; and the impact of this intersection of media practices on how media industries pursue national and global audiences. Students learn both to analyze particular forms of visual communication and to understand the limitations of that communication given studio, network, and corporate practices and priorities as well as cultural, social and technological constraints.', 'Hollywood Rebels: A History of American Independent Film': 'The term “independent film” has come to be defined rather broadly. It can mean a film that was produced outside of a major Hollywood studio. It can mean a film that was made for a miniscule budget. It can refer to a style of storytelling and a mode of production that stands in contrast to what we think of as a conventional Hollywood film. Add to this the rapid advances in digital technology that have made filmmaking equipment vastly more affordable and the fact that the Internet now allows millions to distribute their work without the help of traditional gatekeepers, and the definition of “independent film” becomes even more complex. This course will examine American independent film from all of these perspectives: economic, technological, aesthetic and cultural. We will try to place key films within the context of their times and explore how innovations that often start on the fringes can work their way into the mainstream.', 'Hollywood Genres: Classical Forms and Contemporary Re-Inventions': 'Genre films have been synonymous with Hollywood cinema for almost a century. This course explores the historical forms of Hollywood genres from the classical period of the studio system in the 1930s to the present. We consider the different factors that define genres in particular cases, such as the production standards that shaped the Western, the thematic and stylistic features that characterize film noir, and the reception patterns that exemplify the cult film. Class discussions examine the specific ways that different genres create audience expectations and promote particular interpretive strategies. We also study the historical shifts in the popularity of different genres and changing aesthetic conventions. A central focus of the course is the relationship between generic transformations over time and changes in the social and political relationships of race, class, gender, and sexuality in the U.S.', 'Films, Franchises, and Fandom: Superheroes in Popular Culture': 'In the last 15 years, Hollywood has produced an extensive catalog of films and television programs, particularly developed by the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that has fundamentally transformed prior notions of rigid representations of the superhero archetype. This deluge of superhero media has created a profound shift in re-examining who the superhero is and can be, as it allows for dialogue and debate on issues of gender, race, sexuality, and identity, while complicating the role of villain to further these causes. As a subgenre, it serves a role as part of the larger science-fiction genre that delves into utopias, technology, exploration, and human evolution. And as a lucrative and successful industry franchise that is dependent on fandom, it feeds from a desire produced by its ardent audiences to tell stories of enhanced heroes who are as equally flawed, fallible, and vulnerable as the rest of us but where perseverance, acceptance, and redemption shows itself to be obtainable.', 'Money, Power, Communication': 'Musicians have sung about it; filmmakers have documented it; even video games like "The Sims" have said something about the struggle over money and power who has it, who needs it, and what it can be used for. This course uses a mixture of films, games, lectures, class discussions and exercises to examine this struggle particularly through mass communication. By drawing on examples from a variety of media, the course will illustrate not just how we commonly view money and power but also how we relate our perceptions of those things to other categories such as gender, race and sexuality.', 'Video Game Studies': 'This course focuses on the emergence of PC/console gaming as a medium of communication, an industrial sector, and a cultural arena. Class readings address game design and development strategies and processes, relationships between game publishers and developers, and controversies over authorship/ownership and compensation in the gaming industry. Class discussions examine the emergence of particular game genres, games in learning and media literacy, the evolution of gaming firms, and the emergence of games as a medium in which designers, marketers and players construct and contest gender, race and sexual norms. Writing projects in the course include textual analysis, summarizing and critiquing academic and trade sources, evaluating video game criticism, and a final research paper that examines connections between game design/development, play, and cultural issues in gaming.', 'Popular Music Studies': 'This course examines changes in the structure of the music industry and the evolution of popular music forms and genres. Industrial topics include the rise and fall of various playback technologies, cultural anxieties surrounding genres such as jazz and rap, and intellectual property. This course provides an introduction to the organization and structure of the music industry through an examination of the activities and strategies of labels, publishers, performance rights organizations, startups and subscription services. Students learn about how globalization and new technologies challenge production and distribution norms. Through course readings and listening sessions, students are introduced to debates about commerce and creativity in rock, pop, indie rock, hip hop, electronica, world and remix music.', 'Audio Production': 'Effective sound design can greatly expand visual elements in all forms of media. Digital audio technologies have enhanced traditional media, such as film and television, and continue to develop in new forms, such as interactive cinema environments and mobile technologies. Yet, sound design is no longer reliant on the production of a definitive image, but can produce what is known as synesthesia in this case, aural stimulation producing involuntary cognitive abilities to create visuals. In the realm of new media, the relationship between sound and image has intensified in that equal weight is given to the approach and creation of the sound design to its visual representations. The fundamentals of microphones, digital recording techniques, sound effects and post?production audio mixing will be covered through hands-on demonstrations and individual and collaborative audio projects.', 'Documentary Production': 'This course will teach the basic skills of documentary production, including handheld camera techniques, interviewing methods, writing narration and historical research. In addition, the course presents important issues in contemporary documentary, such as copyright, grassroots distribution strategies and online exhibition. The course will include a brief history of the documentary and students will view a range of documentary genres with different stylistic and narrative approaches. Students will make their own 7-10 minute video documentary for exhibition at the end of the semester.', 'Animation Production': 'Animation and moving graphics operate as powerful forms of communication within various media. This course focuses on the study of the art of animation production, as well as motion design and visual effects, for time-based narratives. Aspects of moving design and its execution are examined in a range of media through theoretical readings, demonstrations, textual analyses of animation in its many forms, and various production projects. Elements of design, such as color, light, typography, 2D/3D space, time, motion, as well as specific animation techniques, are explored.', 'Film Directing': 'Everyone has an image of a film director. Many of us picture a man or woman in a beret with a bullhorn, sitting in a directors chair, barking action! and cut! But what does a director actually do in the real world of filmmaking? Class topics will include visualization, script breakdowns, casting, location scouting, working with actors, shot planning and film grammar, on set procedures and editing. The first half of the semester will give students a foundation in directing through readings, lectures, film analysis and exercises. In the second half, students will form small production teams. Each student will get a chance to direct their own short script (2-4 pages) while the other members in the group serve as crew. Scripts will be provided by LIT 312s screenwriting students. Throughout the production process, there will be opportunities for students to receive feedback on their work both from faculty and peers.', 'Film Producing': 'How does an idea become a movie, television show, web series or any other finished media project? Before the cameras roll and the director yells "action!", the producer must fill in all the practical blanks including honing the idea, budgeting, acquiring funds, developing the creative team, making distribution deals and more that will bring the project to life. This class will examine the role of The Producer in our current merging media landscape. Once students have a grasp of what a producer is, they will become producers themselves. Working in small teams, students will become producers on actual Bentley media productions: creating schedules and budgets, acquiring key crew members, coordinating auditions and casting, securing locations, and developing a marketing and exhibition strategy. Over the course of the semester, guest professionals from Boston\'s media community will speak to the class, and there will be a trip to a local production facility.', 'Design as Communication': 'Visual elements can persuasively communicate a given message, emotion or feeling to a targeted audience. This course focuses on the cumulative effect of typography, color, photographic images and layout. Students also examine the interaction of visual images with written copy, and their combined effect on a message. While this course focuses on print media, students are encouraged, where applicable, to generalize from the print medium to visual images in the electronic media.', 'Podcasting': 'The popularity of podcasts has skyrocketed over the last decade.Due to its low barriers of entry for creators, as well as easily accessible distribution channels, many creators and businesses have used podcasts to join current political and cultural conversations.The podcast holds a unique place in the media landscape for listeners as well, as it is time-based but more accessible and easier to integrate into daily life than other media vying for our attention, such as streaming video.Through this course students will learn to apply audio production techniques to issues and questions about life that intrigue or confound them.Students will learn to generate creative ideas, structure compelling stories, engage in the revision process, and see through a polished creative product to completion.', 'The Art of Editing': 'This course examines the crucial role that editors play in shaping motion pictures, both individually and historically as an industry.Whether it is fiction filmmaking, documentary, or music videos, the editor is the guiding hand that maintains the director’s vision while problem solving and providing creative insight.Students in this class learn about this critical collaborator through lectures, screenings and hands-on editing experiences that allow them to fully appreciate an editor’s impact.', 'Selected Topics in English and Media Studies': 'This course is a special topics course in English and Media Studies.Students may repeat the course with a different topic.', 'Directed Study in English and Media Studies': 'A Directed Study is designed for highly qualified students who, under the direction of a member of the sponsoring academic department, engage in an agreed upon in-depth independent examination, investigation or analysis of a specialized topic.', 'Internship in English and Media Studies': "Introduces the student to some aspect of the creative or cultural industries; emphasizes the particular operations of a company or organization by assigning a student to a professional in the field under whose supervision the intern undertakes tasks and participates in analyzing the practical applications of literary, communication, or media theories.The intern's progress is monitored and evaluated jointly by the field supervisor and the faculty coordinator during the semester internship.", 'Capstone Project in English and Media Studies': 'Undertaken in the last year of coursework, the capstone course requires students to engage in a major research or creative project.', 'Experimental Course in English and Media Studies': 'Experimental courses explore curriculum development, with specific content intended for evolution into a permanent course.A topic may be offered twice before it becomes a permanent course.Students may repeat experimental courses with a different topic for credit.', 'Designing Experiences': 'Life is about having experiences.You can think of your first day of college, a concert you attended, a sporting event, an ad campaign that went viral, or a vacation you took, among endless others.From the transformational to the mundane, we are constantly met with different types of experiences that can impact our lives in various ways.We can have effortless experiences that make things easy, or experiences that change who we are as people.Each has a place, and we need to know how to create both.This course explores the nature of experiences, how we perceive them individually and socially, and how they can be intentionally designed.We will examine from an interdisciplinary perspective to understand how we can craft experiences across industries and domains.Students will leave with a better understanding of experience design, along with how this can be applied to any areas of interest.', 'Content Strategy': 'If information is the commodity of the information age, effective content is the key to building value for organization. This course teaches the basics of content strategy about business and technical subjects. Students will embrace traditional, digital, social communication channels and content creation techniques for a variety of industries including fashion, health, and sports. In the process, students will be introduced to the profession and learn how to sharpen their writing, design, and communication skills.', 'Fundamentals of Design': "The world is dominated by visual images, and Fundamentals of Visual Communication will explore how to choose and present them in clear, effective ways across multiple forms of creative communication.You will build your visual literacy as you learn about typography, color, layout, images, and symbols, and learn to master principles such as image design, visual messaging, alignment, and balance.You will get an insider's look

introduces students to the main areas of public relations writing:news releases, mission statements, public affairs announcements, articles, profiles, brochures, flyers, in-house public relations, and the construction of a media information pack for a specific organization.', 'Experimental Course in XD': 'Experimental courses explore curriculum development, with specific content intended for evolution into a permanent course.A topic may be offered twice before it becomes a permanent course.Students may repeat experimental courses with a different topic for credit.', 'Managerial Communication': 'This course approaches effective communication both as an essential personal-professional skill and as an important function of management.It also discusses the elements of communication (argumentation, structure, style, tone and visual appeal) and presents techniques for increasing effectiveness in each area.Students read, discuss and write about cases based on tasks that managers commonly face, such as explaining changes in policy, writing performance evaluations, analyzing survey results, and communicating with employees, shareholders, the press, and the public.', 'Advanced Visual Communication': 'This course prepares students to apply design methods and tools to professional communication projects.Building on the discussions of typography, color, layout, images and symbols in Fundamentals of Visual Communication (IDCC 240), this course explores how to integrate their use and apply them to complex communication projects.Working in teams on

The goal of this course is to familiarize students with the process of persuasion and social influence in the context of health. Students will gain a firm understanding of how people can influence the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of others. We will explore the current media environment, in which health communication campaigns can utilize a variety of channels including social media and video games. Students will gain practical skills and expertise in persuasive message design.', 'Health of Nations: Anatomy and Function of Health Systems in the United States and Around the World': 'Good health systems contribute to the prosperity of nations. The U.S. stands nearly alone among developed nations in not providing universal healthcare to its citizens. Although no system is perfect, more than 35 countries rated higher in quality, equity and efficiency than the U.S. according to a World Health Organization assessment conducted in 2001. Yet Americans pay far more per capita for healthcare than citizens of any other country. What factors account for this disparity? This course will examine how healthcare is currently delivered in the U.S., how this differs from other countries, and what we might learn from other countries about improving our system. Thus, we will compare the strengths and weaknesses of the present U.S. healthcare system to the healthcare experiences of selected countries around the world toward learning what works in other places, and what might or might not be applicable here as we move closer to reform.', 'Human Nutrition: From Science to Life': 'Every day we are bombarded with information about diet and health, often confusing and contradictory.

Every year, millions of people live with some form of physical or cognitive disability, and all of us have the potential to become disabled at any time. But what is disability exactly? Is it simply a medical problem? Or do disabilities arise from a mismatch between a person's body and her social environment? Is having a disability necessarily bad for you? What value does disability contribute to society? Drawing upon philosophy, memoirs, film, and other sources, this course will explore these and related questions with a particular focus on disability in the United States. Potential topics include different models of disability, the disability rights movement in the U.S., the ethics of causing and preventing disability, feminist perspectives on disability, disability in popular culture, and the relationship between disability and technology.", 'Sports, Games & Values': 'Sports and games are a central part of the human experience, and raise deep and complex philosophical questions. This course will examine a selection of these questions, such as: What is the connection between a game and its rules? Is foul simulation (diving or flopping) a form of cheating? What is the purpose of segregating competitors by gender in sports, and how should gender be determined? Should violent sports like boxing and football be abolished?

Philosophers to be studied are chosen from Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Mill and Marx.', 'Theories of Knowledge': 'This course examines the most important questions that we can ask about our beliefs: When should we take something that we believe to be knowledge and not mere belief? What sort of evidence, reasons or assurances must we have for some belief we hold in order to be justified in holding it? How should we respond to those skeptics who deny that we have knowledge about this for that area of human concern (for example, of ultimate reality, of ethics or of God)? And how should we respond to the radical skeptic who denies that we have any knowledge at all? The course will gain focus on these and similar questions in order to help the student gain a deeper understanding of the nature and limits of human knowledge.', 'Theories of Reality': 'This course is concerned with questions having to do with the nature of existence or reality. Concerning the nature of existence or reality, some have held that everything that exists ultimately reduces to material things or processes "Atoms dancing in the void" as the ancient materialist, Democritus, put it. Others (Bishop Berkeley, for example) have denied the reality of the physical world entirely, asserting that everything that exists is ultimately reducible to spiritual or mind-like things. On the other hand, many in the Western world have embraced some form of metaphysical dualism, which affirms the reality of both the spiritual and the material world; still others (for example, certain Hindus) have denied all such categories, affirming that everything, except for the indivisible, indescribable One, is an illusion. Finally, certain pragmatists and postmodernists claim that we should completely abandon the entire construct.', 'Special Topics in Philosophy': 'This course examines selected issues in philosophy. Possible topics include consciousness and cognition, language and meaning, knowledge and justification, free will, the existence of God, and the problem of evil.', 'Inquiry and Injustice': 'We are curious creatures in search of answers. Where are my keys? Is this feeling really love or just lust? Should I join the revolution? From the mundane to the extraordinary, and everything in between, inquiry is a crucial part of our every-day life in a social world. However, inquiring environments—the spaces where we put forth questions, seek out answers, and look to others for advice, guidance, and support—can also be sites of hostility, distrust, and injustice. This is a course in applied epistemology: it uses philosophical insights concerning the rationality of belief and knowledge and applies them to real-world issues of practical importance.', 'Consciousness and Experience': 'Consciousness is utterly familiar to each of us and yet has proved elusive to any systematic study. We all seem to know intuitively what it is, but it turns out to be very hard to spell out or explain that knowledge. This course will address some key questions about the nature of consciousness by drawing on philosophical and psychological sources. These questions include: How can we explain the relationship between brain events and conscious experience? Is a naturalistic explanation of consciousness in principle available? Can we make sense of phenomena such as lucid dreaming and out-of-body experiences? How should we think of the place of consciousness in the universe?', 'Other Minds': 'When you see another person, you think of that person as having a mind. What, though, entitles you to hold that belief? After all, you could have encountered a zombie, or you could be the only mind in the universe and everything you experience is just a matter of your imagination. This problem has a long-standing history in philosophy. It is called the ‘Problem of Other Minds’. In recent years, it has seen renewed interest, partly because of psychological and neurophysiological work that sheds new empirical light on how we come to understand others as minded creatures, and their movements as actions, on the basis of perceptual experience.', 'Perception and Perspectives': 'This course examines the nature of perception from a philosophical and psychological lens. It inquires into the connection between perception and perspectives. All perception is from some perspective, but we see whole things, not the surfaces from which we have perceptual information. One question we will be considering is how this is possible. Another, closely related question is how perspectives inform our thinking about the objects of perception. How can we know that we are perceiving, and communicating about, the same objects if our perspectives on them are distinct? And how can we come to terms with differences in our value judgements about perceived objects (or events or actions) if perspectives are value-laden? Thinking about perception turns out to be vital for making sense of a world in which our perspectives on public events are starkly distinct.', 'The Computational Mind': 'What does it mean to think?How are computers different from people?How are they the same?This is a class about asking deep questions about intelligence and exploring their far-reaching consequences.Students will survey the history of approaches in artificial intelligence as well as related disciplines like neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and psychology.We will cover concepts such as alignment, connectionism, consciousness, causation, generalizability, information, learning, and symbolism.', 'Loneliness and the Self': 'Loneliness is a pervasive experience of our time. Ever more people report feeling lonely, to the extent that experts talk of a “loneliness epidemic”. Yet it is not obvious what it is that the lonely person experiences: it can’t just be the absence of others or even particular others. Not all hermits feel lonely but some socialites do; you can feel lonely in a crowd but not at all lonely in splendid isolation. In some sense, loneliness is a self-directed emotion. It is an awareness of yourself as being insufficiently connected with other people. This course explores the connection between the self as a social agent and other people. On this basis it then investigates loneliness from a philosophical and psychological perspective. It ends by considering the nexus between loneliness and the political and digital domains.', 'Experimental Course in Phil': 'Experimental courses explore curriculum development, with specific content intended for evolution into a permanent course. A topic may be offered twice before it becomes a permanent course. Students may repeat experimental courses with a different topic for credit.', 'Capitalism and its Critics': 'Our economic system is mostly a capitalist one. Is that a good thing? Or a bad thing? What is capitalism anyway? What are the alternatives to it, and what’s good and bad about them? This is a course about the moral foundations of capitalism. You will learn what capitalism is, what can be said for it, and what can be said against it. You will emerge a more thoughtful defender, or critic, of capitalism. Reading from classic and contemporary sources, we will discuss such topics as the nature and value of property rights, the justification of the welfare state, exploitation in firms and markets, and the connection between capital, freedom, and democratic self-rule.', 'Ethical Theory': 'This course surveys important traditional and contemporary ethicalviews,with emphasis on relating reflective morality to life in the world today. It includes an investigation of absolutism versus relativism, egoism versus altruism,the nature of moral properties and moral language, and the justification of ethicaltheories, such as utilitarianism, deontology, and virtue ethics.', 'Social Philosophy': 'This course examines selected topics in traditional and contemporary theories of society, such as utopia, ideology, social class, racism, economic determinism, freedom and the "post-industrial" age.
